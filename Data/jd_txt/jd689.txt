South Caucasus (RHIYCAUC) is a large-scale, multi-partner Programme aimed
at improving the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of young people in
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.  
The overall objective of RHIYCAUC is to help youth to become aware of
and realize their right to friendly SRH services in all three countries
of the South Caucasus.  Ultimately, RHIYCAUC expects to contribute to
reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions, as well as
curbing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including the
HIV/AIDS in the region.  RHIYCAUC hopes to achieve its programmatic
targets via expanded distribution of information and peer-to-peer
communication, incremental improvements in the availability, quality,
and level of access to youth-friendly SRH service centers, as well as
enhanced SRH policy environment in the country (in partnership with
respective national authorities).
RHIYCAUC Project in Armenia is implemented by the UNFPA Armenia Country
Office (CO) and its national counterparts.  As part of its awareness and
communication activity component, RHIYCAUC has developed a country
website which will be launched in October 2007."
