Database and Content Management System Developer,"UNDP Armenia is implementing the ""Promoting Equal
Rights and Equal Opportunities in Armenia: Women in Local Democracy""
Project (hereinafter the Project) with the financial support of
European Union. The Project commenced in April 2012 and will continue
until April 2015. The national implementing partner of UNDP is the RA
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the responsible partner is the RA
Ministry of Territorial Administration (MTA). The overarching goal of the
Project is to support the advancement of gender equality, the
strengthening of local democracy and the improvement of social cohesion
in Republic of Armenia. The three-year project will achieve its goal
through the following components:
- Strengthen the capacity of women for meaningful participation in
decision making through enhancing the knowledge and skills of women
running for local elections and those elected to local public office; 
- Strengthen the knowledge and capacity of local authorities for
participatory and gender-sensitive governance; 
- Support broad advocacy campaigns on gender equality at the local level
and strengthen the knowledge and capacity of civil society and the media
to engage in constructive dialogue on issues associated with gender and
democratic governance and to promote the non-stereotyped portrayal of
women and men.
The Project aims to create appropriate tools for the effective
coordination of activities among various national and international
actors active in the field of gender equality and local democracy. One of
them is the Donor Mapping Tool, which is currently under development.
This coordination tool will visualize the type of interventions and
projects implemented by national and international organization in the
above-mentioned fields.

and content management system (hereinafter ""DBCMS"") to ensure
comprehensive project related data collection.

- Enable the compilation, systematization and analysis of local
governance data to allow a more nuanced understanding of the gender
profile of political candidacy and leadership at the local level and a
sense of the impact of the Project and other initiatives in the sector
over the long term. 
The DBCMS will enable UNDP and MTA to compile, store, modify, analyze,
filter, and extract information from the database. National and
international partners will be able to access and modify the data related
to their activities and beneficiaries (TBC).
