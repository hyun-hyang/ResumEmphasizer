Software Engineer,"To understand processes going on in thunderstorm clouds
and to forecast turbulences of space weather affecting the safety of the
space missions, a network of particle detectors are operated by Cosmic
Ray Division (CRD) of Alikhanyan National Scientific Laboratory (ANSL).
The detectors are located in a few countries including the main center at
the slopes of Aragats mountains and continuously produces big amount of
time-series. It is crucial for the scientist to have a real-time access
to the data recorded by all the detectors and correlate measurements made
at different locations. To provide this functionality, CRD in
collaboration with Institute for Data Processing and Electronics (IPE) at
Karlsuhe Insitute of Technology (KIT) started to develop Advanced Data
Extraction Infrastructure (ADEI), a web-based data visualization
framework. Using intelligent caching techniques ADEI is providing an
interactive interface able to visualize yearly variations and zoom down
to millisecond ranges. The applicant is expected to join the company's
team and contribute to the ADEI code base.","- Find and fix bugs in existing code;
- Provide technical support and assistance;
- Modify ADEI interface according to the requirements of CRD scientists;
- Implement data analysis modules helping to understand the properties of
the time series and correlation between them;
- Optimize data analysis code by utilizing parallel resources of nowadays
computers, like SIMD instructions, multicore CPUs, and GpGPU computing;
- Participate in the design and implementation of a new HTML5-based
interface;
- Present product at international scientific conferences.","- At least 2 years of experience in Web Programming (AJAX);
- Good knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript);
- Knowledge of one-or-more scripting languages (PHP, Python, Ruby);
- Experience in database programming and design (MySQL or PostgreSQL);
- Basic Linux administration skills;
- Knowledge of C is a plus, experience in parallel programming is a
strong plus;
- Knowledge of mathematical statistics is a plus;
- Fluency in English language.","If interested, please, send your CVs to:artur@... . Mention the position you are applying for in the
