To allocate enough time to make those clubs successful is extremely difficult. Yapz makes running a club and finding partner clubs for events easy and time efficient.\\n\\nWe are looking for a Backend Developer who works with Python, flask, SQLAlchemy and Postgres. The developer should also have a practical understanding of how the backend interacts with the frontend. The roll will include developing the backend of the mobile application and analyzing the user's problems to best reflect solutions within the technology.\\n\\nFor the position, we are offering $10-$30 an hour for about three months. After the brief trial period, we will option up to 5% of the company as equity, effectively making you a part of the founding team. This is the real incentive of the position at this young stage of our growth. As the company grows, formal salaries will take effect on top of the equity incentives. In addition, salaries will grow in accordance with the company's growth, so as the company expands the developer's salary will expand as well.\\n\\nFrom our past experience, we’ve concluded that the perfect developer should be outspoken and brings a different perspective to discussions. The benefit of a startup is that the developers have large control of the direction of the technology. As a result, we want someone vocal who is unrelenting and will always challenge ideas to make sure that the chosen path is the correct one.\"}"
